&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an open source core board project based on STM32H750VBT6 . It can be connected to the carrier board through the M.2 Key-B typed gold fingers and leads to the PWM, IIC, SPI, CAN, UART, RMII, ADC, DAC, USB and other common interfaces. The board also has DAP-Link debugger, NOR-Flash, USB to serial port and other devices to facilitate debugging. In addition, this project also provides a set of program templates that can be easily configured, which can shorten the development cycle for developers. Due to the modular design of this project, the portability and compatibility of the hardware is greatly improved. The hardware and software of this project are based on [AGPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/ZhuYanzhen1/iugandi/blob/master/LICENSE) open source.
